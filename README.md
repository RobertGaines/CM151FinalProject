~ = maybe/maybe not/if we have time


Robert TODO (as far as I can get):

- multiple lightning channels
   \-> have a controller instance thunder4 3+ times
- stereo lightning seperate per strike
- better looking lightning
- footstep sounds
~ make ground semi reflect

Jimmy TODO (as far as I can get):
- make wind vary
- ambient music if possible (evil organ)
- footsteps


# ~~~ OLD CRAP ~~~
Sound:
- *thunder (everyone?)
    - thunder modulated in distance + delay bc of distance
- *rain (Jimmy)
- wind (Robert TEMP)
- footsteps mushy ground (Robert) -> quieter if slower, splooshier if after a jump
- ambient music (Jimmy)
- ~wind through trees -> then need to make trees
- ~breathing?
- ~puddle walking noises? -> + significant work in unity to implement
- ~start with sun and have it dissapear behind clouds and rain starts

Visuals:
- *model for lightning OR diff shaped bolts OR generated (Robert)
- *grass instanced in grid/terrain
- ~ground texture (Robert)
- skybox/dark grey color
- ~maybe blocky cloud models that move
- ~maybe rain falling (Robert)

Controls:
- use built in unity FPS controller (Robert)
